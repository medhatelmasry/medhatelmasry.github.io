IMPORTANT
=========

After push of source code, do the following steps:

1) npm run deploy << not necessary anymore because .yml does this
2) In GitHub: Settings >> Pages >> Custom Domain
    Enter: medhat.ca then click Save
    After about 2 minutes, it should work on medhat.ca

It appears that deployment resets the site by removing the custom domain.
